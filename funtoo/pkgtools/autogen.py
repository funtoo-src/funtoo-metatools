are defined multiple times and other errors that we should catch before processing begins. The work is organized
by the generator (pop plugin) that will be used to generate a list of catpkgs. Before we start, we have
everything organized so that we only need to call `execute_generator` once for each generator. It will start
work for all catpkgs in that generator, and wait for completion of this work before returning.

Similarly to how we queue up all work before we start, `ERRORS` will contain a list of all errors encountered

While it is possible for a `generate()` function to call the `generate()` method on a `BreezyBuild` directly,
in nearly all cases the `BreezyBuild`'s `push` method is called to queue it for processing. When `push` is
called, we want to start the `generate` method as an asyncio `Task` and then keep track of it so we can wait for
all of these `Tasks` to complete.

When these tasks are running, they are using a specific generator (pop plugin) and we want to be able to wait
for these tasks to complete after we have processed all the work for the generator. This is for two reasons --
so we can enforce a limit for the number of generators running at once, and so we do not exit prematurely while
generators have still not completed their work.

`BREEZYBUILD_TASKS` is configured to hold these tasks. They are organized by the 'sub-index', which is a string
name we use to reference the generator internally. That way we can segregate our tasks by generator, which is
important so each generator can wait for only its own tasks to complete.
