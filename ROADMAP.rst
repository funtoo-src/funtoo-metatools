Roadmap

Items to be added soon:

1. FL-11179: Enhanced Reporting
2. Once #1 is complete, add Reports for unfetchable URLs, etc.
3. Release-specific versioning and other YAML metadata, so you
   don't have to copy YAML to different directories if only 
   something such as version is different. This can be done via
   dict merging "release: next: " keys on top of existing keys.
4. Enhanced pipelines that allow stacking.
